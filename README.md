|       MMLU-Pro        |      TIGER-AI-Lab       |     [MMLU-Pro](https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro)     | MMLU-Pro is an improved version of the MMLU dataset. MMLU has long been a reference for multiple-choice knowledge datasets. However, recent studies have shown that it contains noise (some questions are unanswerable) and is too easy (due to the evolution of model capabilities and increased contamination). MMLU-Pro provides ten options instead of four, requires reasoning on more questions, and has undergone expert review to reduce noise. It is of higher quality and more challenging than the original. MMLU-Pro reduces the impact of prompt variations on model performance, a common issue with its predecessor MMLU. Research indicates that models using "Chain of Thought" reasoning perform better on this new benchmark, suggesting that MMLU-Pro is better suited for evaluating the subtle reasoning abilities of AI.

However, the evaluation of this capability lacks standardization: human evaluation is expensive, slow, and lacks objective reproducibility, while automated evaluation based on LLMs may be biased by the evaluator LLM's capabilities or limitations. To address these issues, researchers at Google introduced Instruction Following Evaluation (IFEval), a simple and reproducible benchmark focusing on a set of "verifiable instructions," such as "write over 400 words" and "mention the AI keyword at least 3 times." IFEval identifies 25 such verifiable instructions and constructs approximately 500 prompts, each containing one or more verifiable instructions (2023-11-15). |

| InfiniteBench | OpenBMB | [InfiniteBench](https://github.com/OpenBMB/InfiniteBench) | Understanding and processing long text is an essential capability for large models to advance to a deeper level of understanding and interaction. While some large models claim to handle sequences of 100k+, there is a lack of standardized benchmark datasets. InfiniteBench addresses this by constructing a benchmark for sequences exceeding 100k+, focusing on five key capabilities of large models in handling long text: retrieval, mathematics, coding, question answering, and summarization. (1) Long Context: The average context length in InfiniteBench test data is 195k, far exceeding existing benchmarks. (2) Multi-domain and Multi-language: The benchmark includes 12 tasks in both Chinese and English, covering the five domains mentioned above. (3) Forward-looking and Challenging: The tasks in InfiniteBench are designed to match the capabilities of the strongest current models such as GPT-4 and Claude 2. (4) Realistic and Synthetic Scenarios: InfiniteBench incorporates both real-world data to test the model’s ability to handle practical problems and synthetic data to facilitate the expansion of context windows for testing. InfiniteBench is the first LLM benchmark featuring an average data length surpassing 100K tokens. It comprises synthetic and realistic tasks spanning diverse domains in both English and Chinese. The tasks in InfiniteBench require a thorough understanding of long dependencies in contexts, making the simple retrieval of a limited number of passages from contexts insufficient for these tasks.
